LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph ‚Äî read more about how to get started here. \\n    \\n\\nPart 1: Build a Basic Chatbot¬∂\\nWe\\'ll first create a simple chatbot using LangGraph. This chatbot will respond directly to user messages. Though simple, it will illustrate the core concepts of building with LangGraph. By the end of this section, you will have a built rudimentary chatbot.\\nStart by creating a StateGraph. A StateGraph object defines the structure of our chatbot as a \"state machine\". We\\'ll add nodes to represent the llm and functions our chatbot can call and edges to specify how the bot should transition between these functions.\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\n\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    # Messages have the type \"list\". The `add_messages` function\\n    # in the annotation defines how this state key should be updated\\n    # (in this case, it appends messages to the list, rather than overwriting them)\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\nAPI Reference: StateGraph | START | END | add_messages\\nOur graph can now handle two key tasks:\\n\\nEach node can receive the current State as input and output an update to the state.\\nUpdates to messages will be appended to the existing list rather than overwriting it, thanks to the prebuilt add_messages function used with the Annotated syntax.\\n\\n\\n\\nConcept\\nWhen defining a graph, the first step is to define its State. The State includes the graph\\'s schema and reducer functions that handle state updates. In our example, State is a TypedDict with one key: messages. The add_messages reducer function is used to append new messages to the list instead of overwriting it. Keys without a reducer annotation will overwrite previous values. Learn more about state, reducers, and related concepts in this guide.\\n\\n\\nNext, add a \"chatbot\" node. Nodes represent units of work. They are typically regular python functions.\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\n\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\\n\\n\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n\\n\\n# The first argument is the unique node name\\n# The second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever\\n# the node is used.\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n\\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic\\nNotice how the chatbot node function takes the current State as input and returns a dictionary containing an updated messages list under the key \"messages\". This is the basic pattern for all LangGraph node functions.\\nThe add_messages function in our State will append the llm\\'s response messages to whatever messages are already in the state.\\nNext, add an entry point. This tells our graph where to start its work each time we run it.\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\\n\\nSimilarly, set a finish point. This instructs the graph \"any time this node is run, you can exit.\"\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(\"chatbot\", END)\\n\\nFinally, we\\'ll want to be able to run our graph. To do so, call \"compile()\" on the graph builder. This creates a \"CompiledGraph\" we can use invoke on our state.\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile()\\n\\nYou can visualize the graph using the get_graph method and one of the \"draw\" methods, like draw_ascii or draw_png. The draw methods each require additional dependencies.\\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\n\\ntry:\\n    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\nexcept Exception:\\n    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional\\n    pass\\n\\n\\nNow let\\'s run the chatbot! \\nTip: You can exit the chat loop at any time by typing \"quit\", \"exit\", or \"q\".\\ndef stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):\\n    for event in graph.stream({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]}):\\n        for value in event.values():\\n            print(\"Assistant:\", value[\"messages\"][-1].content)\\n\\n\\nwhile True:\\n    try:\\n        user_input = input(\"User: \")\\n        if user_input.lower() in [\"quit\", \"exit\", \"q\"]:\\n            print(\"Goodbye!\")\\n            break\\n\\n        stream_graph_updates(user_input)\\n    except:\\n        # fallback if input() is not available\\n        user_input = \"What do you know about LangGraph?\"\\n        print(\"User: \" + user_input)\\n        stream_graph_updates(user_input)\\n        break\\n\\nAssistant: LangGraph is a library designed to help build stateful multi-agent applications using language models. It provides tools for creating workflows and state machines to coordinate multiple AI agents or language model interactions. LangGraph is built on top of LangChain, leveraging its components while adding graph-based coordination capabilities. It\\'s particularly useful for developing more complex, stateful AI applications that go beyond simple query-response interactions.\\nGoodbye!\\n\\nCongratulations! You\\'ve built your first chatbot using LangGraph. This bot can engage in basic conversation by taking user input and generating responses using an LLM. You can inspect a LangSmith Trace for the call above at the provided link.\\nHowever, you may have noticed that the bot\\'s knowledge is limited to what\\'s in its training data. In the next part, we\\'ll add a web search tool to expand the bot\\'s knowledge and make it more capable.\\nBelow is the full code for this section for your reference:\\n\\nFull Code\\n\\n\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\n\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\n\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\\n\\n\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n\\n\\n# The first argument is the unique node name\\n# The second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever\\n# the node is used.\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\ngraph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.set_finish_point(\"chatbot\")\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile()\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | StateGraph | add_messages\\n\\n\\n\\nPart 2: üõ†Ô∏è Enhancing the Chatbot with Tools¬∂\\nTo handle queries our chatbot can\\'t answer \"from memory\", we\\'ll integrate a web search tool. Our bot can use this tool to find relevant information and provide better responses.\\nRequirements¬∂\\nBefore we start, make sure you have the necessary packages installed and API keys set up:\\nFirst, install the requirements to use the Tavily Search Engine, and set your TAVILY_API_KEY.\\n%%capture --no-stderr\\n%pip install -U tavily-python langchain_community\\n\\n_set_env(\"TAVILY_API_KEY\")\\n\\nTAVILY_API_KEY:  ¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑\\n\\nNext, define the tool:\\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\\n\\ntool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\\ntools = [tool]\\ntool.invoke(\"What\\'s a \\'node\\' in LangGraph?\")\\n\\nAPI Reference: TavilySearchResults\\n[{\\'url\\': \\'https://medium.com/@cplog/introduction-to-langgraph-a-beginners-guide-14f9be027141\\',\\n  \\'content\\': \\'Nodes: Nodes are the building blocks of your LangGraph.

Each node performs a specific task on the product. In LangGraph, nodes are Python functions that take the current state, do some work, and return an updated state.

The following is all the same as in Part 1, except we have added bind_tools on our LLM.

It relies on the LLM\\'s tool_calling support, which is available in Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and a number of other LLM providers.\\nWe will later replace this with LangGraph\\'s prebuilt ToolNode to speed things up, but building it ourselves first is instructive.\\nimport json\\n\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage\\n\\n\\nclass BasicToolNode:\\n    \"\"\"A node that runs the tools requested in the last AIMessage.\"\"\"\\n\\n    def __init__(self, tools: list) -> None:\\n        self.tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}\\n\\n    def __call__(self, inputs: dict):\\n        if messages := inputs.get(\"messages\", []):\\n            message = messages[-1]\\n        else:\\n            raise ValueError(\"No message found in input\")\\n        outputs = []\\n        for tool_call in message.tool_calls:\\n            tool_result = self.tools_by_name[tool_call[\"name\"]].invoke(\\n                tool_call[\"args\"]\\n            )\\n            outputs.append(\\n                ToolMessage(\\n                    content=json.dumps(tool_result),\\n                    name=tool_call[\"name\"],\\n                    tool_call_id=tool_call[\"id\"],\\n                )\\n            )\\n        return {\"messages\": outputs}\\n\\n\\ntool_node = BasicToolNode(tools=[tool])\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\\n\\nAPI Reference: ToolMessage\\nWith the tool node added, we can define the conditional_edges. \\nRecall that edges route the control flow from one node to the next. Conditional edges usually contain \"if\" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph state and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.\\nBelow, call define a router function called route_tools, that checks for tool_calls in the chatbot\\'s output. Provide this function to the graph by calling add_conditional_edges, which tells the graph that whenever the chatbot node completes to check this function to see where to go next. \\nThe condition will route to tools if tool calls are present and END if not.\\nLater, we will replace this with the prebuilt tools_condition to be more concise, but implementing it ourselves first makes things more clear. \\ndef route_tools(\\n    state: State,\\n):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Use in the conditional_edge to route to the ToolNode if the last message\\n    has tool calls.

This tells the graph \"any time the \\'chatbot\\' node runs, either go to \\'tools\\' if it calls a tool, or end the loop if it responds directly. \\nLike the prebuilt tools_condition, our function returns the END string if no tool calls are made. When the graph transitions to END, it has no more tasks to complete and ceases execution. Because the condition can return END, we don\\'t need to explicitly set a finish_point this time.

You\\'ve created a conversational agent in langgraph that can use a search engine to retrieve updated information when needed. Now it can handle a wider range of user queries. To inspect all the steps your agent just took, check out this LangSmith trace.\\nOur chatbot still can\\'t remember past interactions on its own, limiting its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the next part, we\\'ll add memory to address this.\\nThe full code for the graph we\\'ve created in this section is reproduced below, replacing our BasicToolNode for the prebuilt ToolNode, and our route_tools condition with the prebuilt tools_condition\\n\\nFull Code\\n\\n\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\\n\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\n\\ntool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\\ntools = [tool]\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\\nllm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\\n\\n\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n\\ntool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\\n    \"chatbot\",\\n    tools_condition,\\n)\\n# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile()\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | StateGraph | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition\\n\\n\\n\\nPart 3: Adding Memory to the Chatbot¬∂\\nOur chatbot can now use tools to answer user questions, but it doesn\\'t remember the context of previous interactions. This limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations.\\nLangGraph solves this problem through persistent checkpointing. If you provide a checkpointer when compiling the graph and a thread_id when calling your graph, LangGraph automatically saves the state after each step. When you invoke the graph again using the same thread_id, the graph loads its saved state, allowing the chatbot to pick up where it left off. \\nWe will see later that checkpointing is much more powerful than simple chat memory - it lets you save and resume complex state at any time for error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel interactions, and more. But before we get too ahead of ourselves, let\\'s add checkpointing to enable multi-turn conversations.\\nTo get started, create a MemorySaver checkpointer.\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\\n\\nmemory = MemorySaver()\\n\\nAPI Reference: MemorySaver\\nNotice we\\'re using an in-memory checkpointer. This is convenient for our tutorial (it saves it all in-memory). In a production application, you would likely change this to use SqliteSaver or PostgresSaver and connect to your own DB.\\nNext define the graph. Now that you\\'ve already built your own BasicToolNode, we\\'ll replace it with LangGraph\\'s prebuilt ToolNode and tools_condition, since these do some nice things like parallel API execution. Apart from that, the following is all copied from Part 2.\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\\n\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\n\\ntool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\\ntools = [tool]\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\\nllm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\\n\\n\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n\\ntool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\\n    \"chatbot\",\\n    tools_condition,\\n)\\n# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\\n\\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition\\nFinally, compile the graph with the provided checkpointer.\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\n\\nNotice the connectivity of the graph hasn\\'t changed since Part 2.

This opens up exciting possibilities for more natural, contextual interactions. LangGraph\\'s checkpointing even handles arbitrarily complex graph states, which is much more expressive and powerful than simple chat memory.\\nIn the next part, we\\'ll introduce human oversight to our bot to handle situations where it may need guidance or verification before proceeding.\\nCheck out the code snippet below to review our graph from this section.\\n\\nFull Code\\n\\n\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\\n\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\n\\ntool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\\ntools = [tool]\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\\nllm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\\n\\n\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n\\ntool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\\n    \"chatbot\",\\n    tools_condition,\\n)\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | MemorySaver | StateGraph | add_messages | ToolNode\\n\\n\\n\\nPart 4: Human-in-the-loop¬∂\\nAgents can be unreliable and may need human input to successfully accomplish tasks. Similarly, for some actions, you may want to require human approval before running to ensure that everything is running as intended.\\nLangGraph\\'s persistence layer supports human-in-the-loop workflows, allowing execution to pause and resume based on user feedback. The primary interface to this functionality is the interrupt function. Calling interrupt inside a node will pause execution. Execution can be resumed, together with new input from a human, by passing in a Command. interrupt is ergonomically similar to Python\\'s built-in input(), with some caveats. We demonstrate an example below.\\nFirst, start with our existing code from Part 3. We will make one change, which is to add a simple human_assistance tool accessible to the chatbot.

I\\'ve received some expert advice regarding your request for guidance on building an AI agent. Here\\'s what the experts have suggested:\\n\\nThe experts recommend that you look into LangGraph for building your AI agent. They mention that LangGraph is a more reliable and extensible option compared to simple autonomous agents.\\n\\nLangGraph is likely a framework or library designed specifically for creating AI agents with advanced capabilities. Here are a few points to consider based on this recommendation:\\n\\n1. Reliability: The experts emphasize that LangGraph is more reliable than simpler autonomous agent approaches. This could mean it has better stability, error handling, or consistent performance.\\n\\n2. Extensibility: LangGraph is described as more extensible, which suggests that it probably offers a flexible architecture that allows you to easily add new features or modify existing ones as your agent\\'s requirements evolve.\\n\\n3. Advanced capabilities: Given that it\\'s recommended over \"simple autonomous agents,\" LangGraph likely provides more sophisticated tools and techniques for building complex AI agents.\\n\\nTo get started with LangGraph, you might want to:\\n\\n1. Search for the official LangGraph documentation or website to learn more about its features and how to use it.\\n2. Look for tutorials or guides specifically focused on building AI agents with LangGraph.\\n3. Check if there are any community forums or discussion groups where you can ask questions and get support from other developers using LangGraph.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like more specific information about LangGraph or have any questions about this recommendation, please feel free to ask, and I can request further assistance from the experts.\\n\\nOur input has been received and processed as a tool message. Review this call\\'s LangSmith trace to see the exact work that was done in the above call. Notice that the state is loaded in the first step so that our chatbot can continue where it left off.\\nCongrats! You\\'ve used an interrupt to add human-in-the-loop execution to your chatbot, allowing for human oversight and intervention when needed. This opens up the potential UIs you can create with your AI systems. Since we have already added a checkpointer, as long as the underlying persistence layer is running, the graph can be paused indefinitely and resumed at any time as if nothing had happened.\\nHuman-in-the-loop workflows enable a variety of new workflows and user experiences.

You can go far with this simple state, but if you want to define complex behavior without relying on the message list, you can add additional fields to the state. Here we will demonstrate a new scenario, in which the chatbot is using its search tool to find specific information, and forwarding them to a human for review. Let\\'s have the chatbot research the birthday of an entity. We will add name and birthday keys to the state:\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\n\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n    name: str\\n    birthday: str\\n\\nAPI Reference: add_messages\\nAdding this information to the state makes it easily accessible by other graph nodes (e.g., a downstream node that stores or processes the information), as well as the graph\\'s persistence layer.\\nHere, we will populate the state keys inside of our human_assistance tool. This allows a human to review the information before it is stored in the state. We will again use Command, this time to issue a state update from inside our tool.

I can now provide you with the correct information about LangGraph\\'s release date.\\n\\nLangGraph was initially released on January 17, 2024. This information comes from the human assistance correction, which is more accurate than the search results I initially found.\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n1. LangGraph\\'s original release date: January 17, 2024\\n2. LangGraph Cloud announcement: June 27, 2024\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that LangGraph had been in development and use for some time before the LangGraph Cloud announcement, but the official initial release of LangGraph itself was on January 17, 2024.\\n\\nNote that these fields are now reflected in the state:\\nsnapshot = graph.get_state(config)\\n\\n{k: v for k, v in snapshot.values.items() if k in (\"name\", \"birthday\")}\\n\\n{\\'name\\': \\'LangGraph\\', \\'birthday\\': \\'Jan 17, 2024\\'}\\n\\nThis makes them easily accessible to downstream nodes (e.g., a node that further processes or stores the information).\\nManually updating state¬∂\\nLangGraph gives a high degree of control over the application state. For instance, at any point (including when interrupted), we can manually override a key using graph.update_state:\\ngraph.update_state(config, {\"name\": \"LangGraph (library)\"})\\n\\n{\\'configurable\\': {\\'thread_id\\': \\'1\\',\\n  \\'checkpoint_ns\\': \\'\\',\\n  \\'checkpoint_id\\': \\'1efd4ec5-cf69-6352-8006-9278f1730162\\'}}\\n\\nIf we call graph.get_state, we can see the new value is reflected:\\nsnapshot = graph.get_state(config)\\n\\n{k: v for k, v in snapshot.values.items() if k in (\"name\", \"birthday\")}\\n\\n{\\'name\\': \\'LangGraph (library)\\', \\'birthday\\': \\'Jan 17, 2024\\'}\\n\\nManual state updates will even generate a trace in LangSmith. If desired, they can also be used to control human-in-the-loop workflows, as described in this guide. Use of the interrupt function is generally recommended instead, as it allows data to be transmitted in a human-in-the-loop interaction independently of state updates.\\nCongratulations! You\\'ve added custom keys to the state to facilitate a more complex workflow, and learned how to generate state updates from inside tools.\\nWe\\'re almost done with the tutorial, but there is one more concept we\\'d like to review before finishing that connects checkpointing and state updates. \\nThis section\\'s code is reproduced below for your reference.\\n\\nFull Code\\n\\n\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage\\nfrom langchain_core.tools import InjectedToolCallId, tool\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\\nfrom langgraph.types import Command, interrupt\\n\\n\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n    name: str\\n    birthday: str\\n\\n\\n@tool\\ndef human_assistance(\\n    name: str, birthday: str, tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId]\\n) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Request assistance from a human.\"\"\"\\n    human_response = interrupt(\\n        {\\n            \"question\": \"Is this correct?\",\\n            \"name\": name,\\n            \"birthday\": birthday,\\n        },\\n    )\\n    if human_response.get(\"correct\", \"\").lower().startswith(\"y\"):\\n        verified_name = name\\n        verified_birthday = birthday\\n        response = \"Correct\"\\n    else:\\n        verified_name = human_response.get(\"name\", name)\\n        verified_birthday = human_response.get(\"birthday\", birthday)\\n        response = f\"Made a correction: {human_response}\"\\n\\n    state_update = {\\n        \"name\": verified_name,\\n        \"birthday\": verified_birthday,\\n        \"messages\": [ToolMessage(response, tool_call_id=tool_call_id)],\\n    }\\n    return Command(update=state_update)\\n\\n\\ntool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\\ntools = [tool, human_assistance]\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\\nllm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\\n\\n\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    message = llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])\\n    assert(len(message.tool_calls) <= 1)\\n    return {\"messages\": [message]}\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n\\ntool_node = ToolNode(tools=tools)\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\\n    \"chatbot\",\\n    tools_condition,\\n)\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\\n\\nmemory = MemorySaver()\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | ToolMessage | InjectedToolCallId | tool | MemorySaver | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition | Command | interrupt\\n\\n\\nPart 6: Time Travel¬∂\\nIn a typical chat bot workflow, the user interacts with the bot 1 or more times to accomplish a task. In the previous sections, we saw how to add memory and a human-in-the-loop to be able to checkpoint our graph state and control future responses.\\nBut what if you want to let your user start from a previous response and \"branch off\" to explore a separate outcome? Or what if you want users to be able to \"rewind\" your assistant\\'s work to fix some mistakes or try a different strategy (common in applications like autonomous software engineers)?\\nYou can create both of these experiences and more using LangGraph\\'s built-in \"time travel\" functionality. \\nIn this section, you will \"rewind\" your graph by fetching a checkpoint using the graph\\'s get_state_history method. You can then resume execution at this previous point in time.\\nFor this, let\\'s use the simple chatbot with tools from Part 3:\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\\n\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\n\\ntool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\\ntools = [tool]\\nllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")\\nllm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\\n\\n\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n\\ntool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\\n    \"chatbot\",\\n    tools_condition,\\n)\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(START, \"chatbot\")\\n\\nmemory = MemorySaver()\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\n\\nAPI Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | MemorySaver | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition\\nLet\\'s have our graph take a couple steps.

Building an autonomous agent with LangGraph is definitely an exciting project. Based on the latest information I\\'ve found, here are some insights and tips for building autonomous agents with LangGraph:\\n\\n1. Multi-Tool Agents: LangGraph is particularly well-suited for creating autonomous agents that can use multiple tools. This allows your agent to have a diverse set of capabilities and choose the right tool for each task.\\n\\n2. Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs): You can combine LangGraph with powerful LLMs like Gemini 2.0 to create more intelligent and capable agents. The LLM can serve as the \"brain\" of your agent, making decisions and generating responses.\\n\\n3. Workflow Management: LangGraph excels at managing complex, multi-step AI workflows. This is crucial for autonomous agents that need to break down tasks into smaller steps and execute them in the right order.\\n\\n4. Practical Tutorials Available: There are tutorials available that provide full code examples for building and running multi-tool agents. These can be incredibly helpful as you start your project.\\n\\n5. Langchain Integration: LangGraph is often used in conjunction with Langchain. This combination provides a powerful framework for building AI agents, offering features like memory management, tool integration, and prompt management.\\n\\n6. GitHub Resources: There are repositories available (like the one by anmolaman20) that provide comprehensive resources for building AI agents using Langchain and LangGraph. These can be valuable references as you develop your agent.\\n\\n7. Real-time Adaptation: LangGraph allows you to create agents that can think, reason, and adapt in real-time, which is crucial for truly autonomous behavior.\\n\\n8. Customization: You can equip your agent with specific tools tailored to your use case. For example, you might include tools for web searching, data analysis, or interacting with specific APIs.\\n\\nTo get started with your autonomous agent project:\\n\\n1. Familiarize yourself with LangGraph\\'s documentation and basic concepts.\\n2. Look into tutorials that specifically deal with building autonomous agents, like the one mentioned from Towards Data Science.\\n3. Decide on the specific capabilities you want your agent to have and identify the tools it will need.\\n4. Start with a simple agent and gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the framework.\\n5. Experiment with different LLMs to find the one that works best for your use case.\\n6. Pay attention to how you structure the agent\\'s decision-making process and workflow.\\n7. Don\\'t forget to implement proper error handling and safety measures, especially if your agent will be interacting with external systems or making important decisions.\\n\\nBuilding an autonomous agent is an iterative process, so be prepared to refine and improve your agent over time. Good luck with your project! If you need any more specific information as you progress, feel free to ask.\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve had the agent take a couple steps, we can replay the full state history to see everything that occurred.\\nto_replay = None\\nfor state in graph.get_state_history(config):\\n    print(\"Num Messages: \", len(state.values[\"messages\"]), \"Next: \", state.next)\\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\\n    if len(state.values[\"messages\"]) == 6:\\n        # We are somewhat arbitrarily selecting a specific state based on the number of chat messages in the state.\\n        to_replay = state\\n\\nNum Messages:  8 Next:  ()\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNum Messages:  7 Next:  (\\'chatbot\\',)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNum Messages:  6 Next:  (\\'tools\\',)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNum Messages:  5 Next:  (\\'chatbot\\',)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNum Messages:  4 Next:  (\\'__start__\\',)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNum Messages:  4 Next:  ()\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNum Messages:  3 Next:  (\\'chatbot\\',)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNum Messages:  2 Next:  (\\'tools\\',)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNum Messages:  1 Next:  (\\'chatbot\\',)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNum Messages:  0 Next:  (\\'__start__\\',)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNotice that checkpoints are saved for every step of the graph. This spans invocations so you can rewind across a full thread\\'s history. We\\'ve picked out to_replay as a state to resume from. This is the state after the chatbot node in the second graph invocation above.\\nResuming from this point should call the action node next.\\nprint(to_replay.next)\\nprint(to_replay.config)\\n\\n(\\'tools\\',)\\n{\\'configurable\\': {\\'thread_id\\': \\'1\\', \\'checkpoint_ns\\': \\'\\', \\'checkpoint_id\\': \\'1efd43e3-0c1f-6c4e-8006-891877d65740\\'}}\\n\\nNotice that the checkpoint\\'s config (to_replay.config) contains a checkpoint_id timestamp. Providing this checkpoint_id value tells LangGraph\\'s checkpointer to load the state from that moment in time. Let\\'s try it below:\\n# The `checkpoint_id` in the `to_replay.config` corresponds to a state we\\'ve persisted to our checkpointer.\\nfor event in graph.stream(None, to_replay.config, stream_mode=\"values\"):\\n    if \"messages\" in event:\\n        event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\n==================================\\x1b[1m Ai Message \\x1b[0m==================================\\n\\n[{\\'text\\': \"That\\'s an exciting idea!
